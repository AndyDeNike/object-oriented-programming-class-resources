# Class 9: Intro to OOP

This project will require use of interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

Start by copying the url to this repository and uploading it to a notebook service.

If you do not already have a cloud based notebook service, we recommend our own RMOTR Notebooks:  https://notebooks.rmotr.com/ <br/>
OR <br/>
Microsoft Azure notebooks:  https://notebooks.azure.com

If you want to run notebooks locally (the following instructions may very depending on your setup):

### Install and run the notebook

```bash
$ pip install jupyter
$ jupyter notebook --ip=127.0.0.1
```

*It is highly recommended to run non-local, cloud based notebooks intially when first learning to use notebooks*
